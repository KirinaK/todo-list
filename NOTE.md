1) See todo comments through all the project
2) Why is .gitkeep in assets folder
3) Create `img` folder in assets and move all images inside
4) It's better to order alphabetically all import - try to find this in the web
5) Create a shared folder that will include all shared services, models, directives and etc. for this project
   or if it has been created already - just move it
6) As for me it's a little bit weird to create a exportable file only for a one variable (see contants folder)
7) Also I would add stylelint and fix all code style for CSS
8) Add types for all thing in the application
9) Add empty lines between code - it's a little bit hardly to read
10) Check login component ts => fix errors provided by typescript, add ngOnDestroy, ...
11) Move services folder to shared folder
12) Have a better naming for files inside shared folder
13) ADD TSLINT and check all files
14) Check logging service => what noop is mean and check this via tslint
15) Need to complicate logger service
16) Check some files => there are a little bit unused code
17) FORMAT all code in the app - HTML CSS JS
18) Check todo-page component - find a memory leak and check it via tslint
19) Check new-item component - find a memory leak and check it via tslint
20) A big problem with ngOnDestroy - saw a lot of same errors
21) It's better to add a new form for the sign up button and do not block it by default
22) The sing up is not working => so I can't use application
